This file is intended to give you a brief overview and starting guide to LEAKER. It is not extensive, as many attacks

"""

# ----- 1: Keyword Attack Evaluation -----#

###### PRE-PROCESSING ######
# To use LEAKER, the data source you want to use needs to be pre-processed and indexed *once* for later use.
# Let's start with the Enron keyword dataset, available at https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./enron/.
# Extract it into the data_sources directory and select the folder to index:
enron_dir = DirectoryEnumerator("data_sources/Enron/maildir")

# We can filter certain files and sub-directories by calling instances of Filter (found in leaker.preprocessing.data).
# Let's replicate the experiments of [CGPR15] for Count.v2 on the "sent" directories of Enron emails by calling
# a RelativeContainsFilter("_sent_mail/") that filters out all files not in a "_sent_mail/" directory.
# Then, the files need to be loaded via a FileLoader that parses the file according to a specified FileParser.
# Here, we use the EMailParser() to parse email text files. Alternatively, just calling FileLoader() will convert
# different file types to text files. Then, FileToDocument() converts the extracted text into an internal document.
# These filters and loaders represent a pipeline arriving at InputDocuments.
enron_sent_filter: Filter[RelativeFile, InputDocument] = RelativeContainsFilter("_sent_mail/") | \
                                                         FileLoader(EMailParser()) | FileToDocument()

# These InputDocuments need to be indexed and stored via a Writer, using a WhooshWriter here:
enron_sent_sink: Sink[InputDocument] = WhooshWriter("enron_sent")

# The Preprocessor executes the above specified pre-processing (this can take multiple minutes):

preprocessor = Preprocessor(enron_dir, [enron_sent_filter > enron_sent_sink])
preprocessor.run()

log.info("Pre-processing done.")

# The above process works similarly for query logs and range data, see e.g. the index_range.py in evaluation/range.

###### LOADING ######
# Now, we can load the "enron_sent" data collection using the WhooshBackend. This can take multiple minutes due to
# pre-computation, but you will notice a decrease in runtime in the next loading due to caching:
backend = WhooshBackend()
enron_db: Dataset = backend.load_dataset("enron_sent")

log.info(f"Loaded {enron_db.name()} data. {len(enron_db)} documents with {len(enron_db.keywords())} words.")

# In [CGPR15], the collection was restricted to the most frequent 500 keywords. In this example, we do the same,
# by restricting the size and specifying the Selectivity:
enron_db_restricted = enron_db.restrict_keyword_size(500, Selectivity.High)
log.info(f"{enron_db_restricted.name()} now contains {len(enron_db_restricted)} documents with "
         f"{len(enron_db_restricted.keywords())} words.")

# For the range case, you can similarly use a RangeBackend.

###### EVALUATION ######
# We can evaluate according to many criteria:
attacks = [Countv2]  # the attacks to evaluate
runs = 5  # Amount of evaluations

# From this, we can construct a simple EvaluationCase:
evaluation_case = EvaluationCase(attacks=attacks, dataset=enron_db_restricted, runs=runs)

kdr = [.5, .6, .75, .85, .95]  # known data rates
reuse = True  # If we reuse sampled datasets a number of times (=> we will have a 5x5 evaluation here)
# From this, we can construct a KnownDatasetSampler:
dataset_sampler = KnownDatasetSampler(kdr_samples=kdr, reuse=reuse)

query_space = PartialQuerySpace  # The query space to populate. Here, we use partial sampling from
# the data collection. With a query log, a QueryLogSpace is used.
sel = Selectivity.High  # When sampling queries, we use high selectivity keywords
qsp_size = 500  # Size of the query space
sample_size = 150  # Amount of queries attacked at a time (sampled from the query space)
allow_repetition = False  # If queries can repeat
# From this, we can construct a QuerySelector:
query_selector = QuerySelector(query_space=query_space, selectivity=sel, query_space_size=qsp_size, queries=sample_size,
                               allow_repetition=allow_repetition)

out_file = "countv2_enron_sent_high_partial.png"  # Output file (if desired), will be stored in data/figures

# With these parameters, we can set up the Evaluator:
eva = KeywordAttackEvaluator(evaluation_case=evaluation_case, dataset_sampler=dataset_sampler,
                             query_selector=query_selector,
                             sinks=KeywordMatPlotLibSink(out_file=out_file), parallelism=8)

# And then run it:
eva.run()

# ----- 2: Range Attack Evaluation -----#
# As mentioned, pre-processing and loading range data works similarly to the keyword case.
# Let's therefore consider a randomly generated data collection with values in 1,...,500, n=1200 and repeated values:
example_db = RandomRangeDatabase("test_db", 1, 500, length=1200, allow_repetition=True)

log.info(f"Created range db {example_db.name()} of {len(example_db)} entries with density {example_db.get_density()},"
         f" N={example_db.get_max()}.")

###### EVALUATION ######
# We can evaluate according to many criteria:
attacks = [GeneralizedKKNO]  # the attacks to evaluate
runs = 10  # Amount of evaluations
error = MAError  # Type of error (see leaker.evaluation.errors)
# From this, we can construct a simple EvaluationCase:
evaluation_case = EvaluationCase(attacks=attacks, dataset=example_db, runs=runs, error=error) #

query_space = UniformRangeQuerySpace(example_db, 10 ** 6, allow_repetition=True, allow_empty=True) # Query distribution.
# Here, we use the uniform query space with 10**6 queries being created initially. With a query log of real-world
# queries, a QueryLogRangeQuerySpace is used instead (see leaker.attack.query_space for more spaces).
query_counts = [100, 500, 1000, 10 ** 4]  # How many queries to attack, each amount being sampled from the query space.
normalize = True  # Whether to display absolute error results or normalize them.

out_file = "genkkno_uniform.png"  # Output file (if desired), will be stored in data/figures

# With these parameters, we can set up the Evaluator:
eva = RangeAttackEvaluator(evaluation_case=evaluation_case, range_queries=query_space, query_counts=query_counts,
                           normalize=True, sinks=RangeMatPlotLibSink(out_file=out_file), parallelism=5)
# And then run it:
eva.run()

# ----- 3: New Attack -----#
# To implement a new attack, you just need to create a new class fulfilling the Attack interface, i.e.,
# implementing the name(), required_leakage(), and recover(queries) methods.
